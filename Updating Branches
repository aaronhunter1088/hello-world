So master branch will always have the best and brightest code. But how do we get it like that, especially after creating many branches? Easy as cake.
1) First save, and commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
2) Then, push your changes to origin branch.
3) Next, create pull requests to merge your changes into upper level branches, up to master.
4) Finally, to update the current branch (if it is # behind master), pull master code into that branch, make a change, save and commit the change. Finally, push the change to your local branch (and origin branch) and see your branch become 1 commit ahead of master. 

You can verify master is up to date by checking the last commit message. It should match the meaningful commit message you entered back in step 1.
